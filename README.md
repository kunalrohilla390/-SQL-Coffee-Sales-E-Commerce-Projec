SQL Coffee Sales E-Commerce Project
📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data from a fictional e-commerce platform using SQL. It focuses on uncovering insights related to customer behavior, product performance, city-wise trends, and monthly growth. The goal is to demonstrate how structured queries can transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used
- JOIN operations across multiple tables (sales, products, customers, city)
- Aggregations using SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG()
- Window functions like DENSE_RANK() and LAG() for ranking and time-based comparisons
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and DATE_FORMAT() for monthly analysis
- Subqueries and nested logic for advanced filtering
